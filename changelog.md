<details>

<summary>Major Changes</summary>

- Program version updated to 1.1
- cmakeeasy txt file directory changed from `/opt/local` to `/etc/local`
- Updated `install.sh` script to remove old text data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's my own fault for not understanding the relationship of `/opt` compared to `/etc`. As such, I updated the program data and relocated everything to `/etc/local`
