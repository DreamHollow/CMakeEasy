    Please set the 'source files' that allow your program to run.
    Source files are necessary for your program to run.
    They are NOT libraries.

    These files will be automatically amended as 'src/[your file]'
    or folders may be included with the syntax of '/[folder]/[your file]'
    that amends to 'src/[your folder]/[your file]' automatically.

    For example: main.cpp (becomes src/main.cpp)
