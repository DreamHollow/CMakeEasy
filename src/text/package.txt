If you have any packages to find, please enter them here.

Packages are NOT regular directories or folders.

Please note that if your package has 'components', they must
also be added in order for the package to work.
This step will come later as the program asks for libraries,
as the program will also link the libraries and add components.

Please note that not understanding how this feature works
may result on a compilation error by CMake and possibly
generate a non-functional CMake cache.
