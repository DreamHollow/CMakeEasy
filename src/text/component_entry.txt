        
Would you like to link any libraries?
Please keep in mind that if CMake cannot find your library,
linking these files will not work.
        
Please note that while adding libraries, you will need
to link any necessary components as well.

If you don't need to link any components to your library,
CMakeEasy will allow you to skip component entry.
        
Start linking libraries (and) components?
