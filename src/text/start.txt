Welcome to the CMakeLists all-purpose generator!
This generator will help further simplify CMakeLists.txt generation
for inexperienced users.

This program will not tell you how to use CMake. Learning proper CMake
usage requires that you read the documentation at 
https://cmake.org/documentation/

Please keep in mind that incorrect inputs will force the program to
terminate prematurely.

This version of CMakeEasy works exclusively for
configuring CMake to work with C++ files.

You will be asked what version of CMake you are using.
A major and minor version of the program must be provided.
This will designate the 'minimum version' needed for things to work.

What is the major version of CMake that you are using?
Example: [3].22.1
