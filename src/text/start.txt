Welcome to the CMakeLists all-purpose generator!

This generator will help further simplify CMakeLists.txt generation
for inexperienced users.

This program will not tell you how to use CMake. Learning proper CMake
usage requires that you read the documentation at 
https://cmake.org/documentation/

Please keep in mind that some incorrect inputs will force the program to
terminate prematurely.

Also please keep in mind that CMakeEasy is not a cure-all and incorrect data
in a CMakeLists.txt file may cause programs to build incorrectly or not at all.

This version of CMakeEasy works exclusively for
configuring CMake to work with C++ files.

You will be asked what version of CMake you are using.
A major, minor, and release version of the program must be provided.
This will designate the 'minimum version' needed for things to work.

The brackets and text will explain which data is being entered.

What is the major version of CMake that you are using?
For example: [3].22.1
