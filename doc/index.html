    <h1>Welcome to the CMakeEasy Documentation page!</h1>
    <p class="intro">Because the CMakeEasy program has become more complex in it's various iterations,
        this HTML-formatted documentation was provided to help developers understand how the program works.
    </p>
    <h5>This page is a work in progress.</h5>

    <h2>AltString</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The AltString class of CMakeEasy reduces clutter within program operation.</p>
    <p>It's purposes include:</p>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>To provide explanations of program functions that are built-in without additional files.</li>
        <li>To reduce clutter of the main Application so that developers can see what functions execute.</li>
        <li>To streamline the use of frequent CMake commands or strings used in list creation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p>To start, AltString 'initializes' several common CMake strings used for the purpose of creating CMake lists.
        AltString is comprised of several functions that hold sets of instructions for users who might not understand how to use the software.</p>
        <p>Many functions follow this pattern with such examples as <b>start()</b>, <b>package()</b>, <b>standard()</b>, and so forth.</p>
        <p>The <b>declare(int num)</b> function is exclusively used to provide pre-written statements for CMakeLists.txt writing, taken from the <b>declarations</b> vector. The number provided
        to the <b>declare(int num)</b> function determines which statement is added.</p>
        <p>The <b>free()</b> function clears out vectors when they are no longer in use.</p>

    <h3>Notice</h3>
    <p>How AltString outputs instructions may change in the near future. This documentation will be updated if necessary.</p>

    <h2>Application</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Application class of CMakeEasy centralizes functionality of the program.</p>
    <p>It's purposes include:</p>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>Replacing "int main" as the main section of program execution.</li>
        <li>Providing step-by-step lines of code for execution and error checking.</li>
        <li>Performing memory-safe entry checking for <b>std::cin</b> prompts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p>The Application class is mostly a chronological template of code execution.</p>
    <p>Important variables and configurations are made via <b>init_vars()</b> and <b>init_components()</b> functions.</p>
    <p>The <b>free()</b> function is designed to only execute if the program encounters a serious error.
        Because smart pointers do not de-allocate during a throw, it deletes them instead.</p>

    <h2>Globals (Header)</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Globals header holds static variables that can be used through the whole program.</p>
    <p>This header is mostly used for debugging statements and for universal boolean states.</p>

    <h2>Manager</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Manager class of CMakeEasy handles file creation and manipulation,
        containing the process to reduce clutter and functionality on the main Application.</p>
    <p>It's purposes include:</p>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>Creating the default configurations for the outputted CMakeLists.txt file.</li>
        <li>Managing program-relevant data relative to the home directory. [Cross Platform]</li>
        <li>Writing data directly to CMakeLists.txt</li>
    </ul>
