    <h1>Welcome to the CMakeEasy Documentation page!</h1>
    <p class="intro">Because the CMakeEasy program has become more complex in it's various iterations,
        this HTML-formatted documentation was provided to help developers understand how the program works.
    </p>
    <h5>This page is a work in progress.</h5>

    <h2>AltString</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The AltString class of CMakeEasy reduces clutter within program operation.</p>
    <p>It's purposes include:</p>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>To reduce clutter of the main Application so that developers can see what functions execute.</li>
        <li>To streamline the use of frequent CMake commands or strings used in list creation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p>To start, AltString 'initializes' several common CMake strings used for the purpose of creating CMake lists.
        AltString is comprised of several functions that hold sets of instructions for users who might not understand how to use the software.</p>
        <p>The <b>const std::string declare(int num)</b> function is exclusively used to provide pre-written statements for CMakeLists.txt writing, taken from the <b>declarations</b> vector. The number provided
        to the <b>const std::string declare(int num)</b> function determines which statement is added.</p>
        <p>The <b>free_data()</b> function clears out vectors when they are no longer in use.</p>
        <p>The various other functions in AltString are labeled after their position in program
            execution, usually relevant to the Application class.</p>

    <h3>Notice</h3>
    <p>AltString originally handled instructional output, it is now mostly a handler class.</p>

    <h2>Application</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Application class of CMakeEasy centralizes functionality of the program.</p>
    <p>It's purposes include:</p>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>Replacing "int main" as the main section of program execution.</li>
        <li>Providing step-by-step lines of code for execution and error checking.</li>
        <li>Performing memory-safe entry checking for <b>std::cin</b> prompts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p>The Application class is mostly a chronological template of code execution.</p>
    <p>Important variables and configurations are made via <b>void init_vars()</b> and <b>void init_components()</b> functions.</p>
    <p>The function <b>input_val()</b> comes in three forms. <b>short input_val(short& num)</b>,
    <b>int input_val(int& num)</b>, and <b>float input_val(float& float)</b>.</p>
    <p>The overloaded function of <b>input_val()</b> is meant to do is to directly assign a variable
    through the function, run <b>entry_check()</b>, then allow the variable to be used if the check passes.</p>
    <p><b>std::string input_string(std::string& str)</b> serves a very similar function to <b>input_val()</b>,
    though allowing for entry checks for strings rather than numeric values.</p>
    <p><b>void entry_check()</b> is a function that performs standard <i>std::cin.fail()</i> checks, to prevent
    data corruption between input and output of parameters.
    
    <p>The <b>free_data()</b> function is designed to only execute if the program encounters a serious error.
        Because smart pointers do not de-allocate during a throw, it deletes them instead.</p>
    <h3>Flow</h3>
    <p>The Application class has a 'flow' to it's functionality that is important, because it is the true entry point of what makes up CMakeEasy.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Application initializes the variables and objects that it will need to accomplish it's tasks, these functions beginning with <b>init</b> in their names.</li>
    <li>Depending on what version of CMakeEasy you are running, you may be asked to select a directory to write your CMakeLists.txt file to. This will be explained by <b>select_dir()</b> and may be executed by a similar function.</li>
    <li>The initial setup for the first lines of CMakeLists.txt will be explained and executed by the <b>start()</b> and <b>early_setup()</b> functions respectively.</li>
    <li>Package entry, including package attributes, are explained and handled by <b>package()</b> and <b>package_setup()</b>, including necessary components of libraries.</li>
    <li>The C++ standards for your program, if relevant, are entered here. The <b>standard()</b> function explains how these will be entered into the file, while <b>standard_setup()</b> allows you to select your C++ options.</li>
    <li>The program will ask you if you want 'verbose output', an advanced feature of CMake that explains the steps taken by your 'make' file during the compilation process. This is handled by one function, <b>verbose_output()</b></li>
    <li>The functions <b>source()</b> and <b>include_dirs()</b> serve a similar purpose, informing the user about how CMakeEasy handles /src and /include directories. Then any user-configured options are determined by <b>source_and_includes()</b></li>
    <li>Because CMake requires package information to be verified twice, the <b>package_loop()</b> function evaluates previously entered package information and links components. This is similar to how the information was first entered in <b>package_setup()</b></li>
    <li>At this point in the porgram, the user is asked if they would like to add any library or component information that they may have missed earlier. <b>input_val()</b> is called to evaluate if the program should continue normally, or loop back to a <i>GOTO</i> loop called <b>PACK_LOOP</b> - this loop breaks when the user has verified that no more packages need to be added.</li>
    <li>The <b>finish_touches()</b> function writes information to CMakeLists.txt based on previous input, mostly regarding C++ standards.</li>
    <li>The <b>promote()</b> and <b>generate_final()</b> simply ask the user if they would like to share information on CMakeEasy with comments tacked on to the final CMakeLists.txt file. This is entirely optional.</li>
    <li>After these functions, CMakeEasy winds down and (if applicable) displays final debug information before terminating execution.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Globals (Header)</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Globals header holds static variables that can be used through the whole program.</p>
    <p>This header is mostly used for debugging statements and for static booleans.</p>
    <h2>Manager</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Manager class of CMakeEasy handles file creation and manipulation,
        containing the process to reduce clutter and functionality on the main Application.</p>
    <p>It's purposes include:</p>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>Creating the default configurations for the outputted CMakeLists.txt file.</li>
        <li>Managing program-relevant data relative to the home directory. [Cross Platform]</li>
        <li>Writing data directly to CMakeLists.txt</li>
        <li>Reading instructional data to console for the user.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p>The Manager class greatly improves the ease in how file writing takes place.</p>
    <p>Upon construction, the class immediately initializes relevant data.
        This data is checked if it has been safely loaded in, whether it is read-only, and if it can be opened.</p>
    <p>This class also assumes responsibility for determining what kind of file system it is working with,
    initializing the placement of CMakeLists.txt either in the <i>home</i> directory of a Linux user or creating
    a subdirectory inside the CMakeEasy directory called <i>Lists</i> on a Windows system. It then places the file inside of that directory.

    <p>The <b>write()</b> function directly writes strings to file, accepting arguments as either integers or character arrays.</p>
    <p>As with other classes, Manager has a <b>free_data()</b> function that makes sure heap allocated data is freed during an exception.</p>

    <p>The <b>read()</b> function only works on read-only files, passing the full context of the file as an output string.</p>
