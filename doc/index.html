    <h1>Welcome to the CMakeEasy Documentation page!</h1>
    <p class="intro">Because the CMakeEasy program has become more complex in it's various iterations,
        this HTML-formatted documentation was provided to help developers understand how the program works.
    </p>
    <h5>This page is a work in progress.</h5>

    <h2>AltString</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The AltString class of CMakeEasy reduces clutter within program operation.</p>
    <p>It's purposes include:</p>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>To provide explanations of program functions that are built-in without additional files.</li>
        <li>To reduce clutter of the main Application so that developers can see what functions execute.</li>
        <li>To streamline the use of frequent CMake commands or strings used in list creation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p>To start, AltString 'initializes' several common CMake strings used for the purpose of creating CMake lists.
        These preformatted strings are later called through a function known as <b>declare()</b> 
        that prints the string stored within the <b>declarations</b> vector.</p>

    <h2>Application</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Application class of CMakeEasy centralizes functionality of the program.</p>
    <p>It's purposes include:</p>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>Replacing "int main" as the main section of program execution.</li>
        <li>Providing step-by-step lines of code for execution and error checking.</li>
        <li>Performing memory-safe entry checking for <b>std::cin</b> prompts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Globals (Header)</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Globals header holds static variables that can be used through the whole program.</p>
    <p>This header is mostly used for debugging purposes and for universal boolean states.</p>

    <h2>Manager</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Manager class of CMakeEasy handles file creation and manipulation, containing the process to reduce clutter and functionality on the main Application.</p>
